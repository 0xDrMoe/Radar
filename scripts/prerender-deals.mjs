#!/usr/bin/env node
// Prerenders every public deal page to a static file under dist/client, so the Worker can hand it
// back from the asset binding without rendering anything. The home page, the six static pages and
// the two sign-in shells are baked the same way for every locale (STATIC_PAGES), and sitemap.xml and
// robots.txt too (see bakeCrawlerFiles).
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// One deal page render costs several D1 queries and a full React SSR pass, which does not reliably
// fit in the platform's per-request CPU limit. The colo cache in worker/index.ts fixes every
// request after the first, but it cannot fix the first — the cache has to be populated by a render
// that might itself be killed. Baking the HTML at build time removes the render from the request
// path entirely. Assets that match a path are served without invoking the Worker at all, so they
// keep answering even when rendered routes cannot.
//
// Why the pages are rendered here rather than by `vinext build`
// -------------------------------------------------------------
// vinext does have a prerender phase, but it drives the built bundle in plain Node and passes
// `process.env` as the Worker env (see node_modules/vinext/dist/server/prod-server.js). There is
// no D1 there, so a deal page cannot render — which is also why tests/rendered-html.test.mjs only
// covers pages that never touch the database. This script supplies the missing half: a real
// SQLite database holding a copy of production, exposed through a D1-shaped facade, reached by
// aliasing the `cloudflare:workers` module the app imports `env` from.
//
// The copy is local and thrown away. That matters beyond speed: rendering a sponsored deal page
// runs an `UPDATE sponsorships SET clicks=clicks+1`, so pointing this at the live database would
// silently inflate every sponsor's click count by one per locale per deploy.

// and it was being rendered once per colo per deploy, then again every fifteen minutes, to produce
// the same bytes. The Worker serves each ahead of its colo cache (BAKED_PAGES in worker/index.ts),
// and wrangler.jsonc routes each to the Worker first; tests/prerender.test.mjs keeps the three lists
// in step.
//
// The sign-in shells render only in a build that carries Clerk's publishable key

// `$RX("B:0", ...)` script after it when it failed while the response was streaming (both from
// react-dom/server; tests/prerender.test.mjs renders each and holds this to them). Served live,

// back from the asset binding, ahead of its admission gate and without rendering anything
// (topLevelFile in worker/index.ts).
//
// app/sitemap.ts and app/robots.ts stay the source: this fetches them through the built Worker,
// exactly as a crawler would, so `vinext dev` (which has no dist/client) and any deploy that skips
// this script keep serving the dynamic versions. That is also why the stand-in asset binding below
// answers 404: finding no baked file, the Worker renders the route. The price is freshness: a deal
// published after a deploy is in the sitemap from the next one. Deploys run at least daily
