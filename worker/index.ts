// admission-control gate refuses excess requests immediately, before any real work starts, with a
// small controlled response instead of letting the isolate be driven into a crash. It's a
// per-isolate limit, not a site-wide one — the platform runs many isolates in parallel for real
// traffic, so this only engages when a single isolate is asked for more than it can safely
// process. The limit is MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS in worker/admission.ts.
//
// A request the Workers runtime hard-kills for exceeding ITS OWN resource limit can be torn
// down without ever running a normal `finally` block, so a plain counter incremented here would
// have no way back down for those killed requests and the isolate would keep refusing requests
// with nothing else in flight. So a slot is held only while its request shows signs of life: each
// admitted request touches its slot from a timer of its own (HEARTBEAT_MS), a killed request's
// timers die with it, and a slot that has gone quiet is dropped at the next admission check. A
// killed request is followed by at most STALE_AFTER_MS of OVERLOADED answers rather than a full
// MAX_REQUEST_AGE_MS. worker/admission.ts has the details.
//
// A live request still holds its slot however long it runs, up to MAX_REQUEST_AGE_MS. Every page
// render answers within RENDER_DEADLINE_MS (the watchdog below), so a slot older than that plus a
// margin is not a render at all. An /api request that genuinely runs longer loses its slot early,
// which admits one request more than the cap for the rest of it: a far smaller cost than refusing

// Colo-level cache for anonymous public pages.

// can reliably spend on the platform's per-request limit, even with no other load. That is the
// render being too expensive, not load — the admission gate above does not help with it.
//
// Nothing on those pages is per-second. The only time-dependent copy is day-granular ("Ends
// today"), and LocalTime re-renders in the reader's own timezone on the client regardless. The
// only per-request variance is the handful of query parameters a page's server render reads
// (SERVER_READ_PARAMS below: on a deal page `?return=`, `?postal=`, `?zip=` and `?all=`, which
// change the back link and the per-location distances) and a signed-in reader, whose saved postal
// feeds those same distances. So an anonymous document request whose query carries none of those
// is answered with the page every signed-out visitor of that address gets, and serving it from the
// colo's cache turns a full render into a cache lookup. The Worker still runs on a hit, but it does
// almost no CPU work — which is the limit that was being hit.
//
// Freshness uses the same stale-while-revalidate shape as loadSnapshot() in the deals API: a hit
// inside FRESH_MS is served as-is, a hit past it is served immediately and kicks off a background
// re-render (one per colo at a time; see REFRESH_LEASE_MS). So a staff edit in admin reaches the

// they are baked at deploy like the home page. Clerk's own steps under them (/sign-in/factor-one,

//
// It used to be "any query string at all, and the request renders": the only way to be sure a new
// parameter could never serve one reader's page to another. But it meant nearly nothing a real
// visitor asked for was ever answered without a render. The home page rewrites its own address to
// /en?country=CA on a first visit, so every reload, Back and shared link of it rendered; the deal
// page's back link is /en?city=Ottawa; sign-in links all carry ?redirect_url=; campaign tags, click
// ids and load-test cache-busters ride on everything. Their server renders read none of those -
// the home page applies its filters in the browser, sign-in reads redirect_url from the address bar
// - and only vinext's echo of the address in the page's bootstrap script differed.
//
// So a request whose parameters are all ones its route's server render does not read is answered as
// the bare address: the baked page, then the colo's copy, and on a miss the bare address's own
// render, which is stored for the next reader. The browser's address bar keeps the parameters, and
// the page's own script reads them from there (HomeClient's filters, CreatorLink's ?c= and ?camp=,
// sign-in's redirect_url), exactly as it does when they arrive on a client-side navigation. A
// parameter in the route's list - a deal page's `return`, `postal`, `zip` and `all`, which change
// the back link, the distances and the list of locations - makes the request personal, as before.
// So does any query at all on a route that is not in this table: a page added later fails closed
// rather than silently sharing one reader's render.
//
// Only the bare address is ever rendered for such a request, stored or refreshed (storePage,
// refreshPage), so a stored copy's echo is always empty and a miss costs one render. A miss with
// parameters used to be rendered as it came, with the bare page rendered beside it in the

// and that the admission slots above age out for. vinext loads route modules lazily and has every
// concurrent request for a route await one shared in-flight load, cleared only when it settles; the
// message catalogues were a per-request dynamic import every locale render awaited. A request
// hard-killed on the platform's CPU limit while one of those loads is being evaluated can
// leave it pending for good, and every later render on that isolate awaits it and hangs. The
// catalogues are now static imports, evaluated once when the isolate starts (i18n/request.ts), but

// and clear a load that will never settle.

// renderDeadlineMs is answered without it (answerWithoutRender): the page's prerendered file if it
// has one, standing in even for a personalized deal page or a signed-in reader's home page; the
// colo's copy of the page if there is one, however old; otherwise a 503 that says so, instead of a
// tab that spins until the visitor gives up. The path goes to console.error so
// `wrangler tail` shows which routes an isolate is stuck on. Its admission slot is released when it
// returns, like any other request's. After a miss the isolate uses a much shorter deadline for a
// while (WEDGED_RENDER_DEADLINE_MS), so a wedged isolate does not hold each visitor for the full
// eight seconds, while one that has recovered still renders within it.
//
