// The rules on advertising drink prices, by province and state, and the check that applies them.
//
// Why this exists
// ---------------
// A large share of Radar's catalog is happy hour, and drink prices are regulated wherever Radar
// lists them. The rules bind the bar, not Radar, but a listing that describes something the bar is
// not allowed to do is evidence against it, and a few rules reach anyone who advertises: Quebec's
// rules on content apply to "nul" (anyone), and British Columbia's guidance says people without a
// liquor licence may not advertise liquor prices at all. A stale price is a trust problem; an
// illegal one is worse. So drink deals are checked against the rules of the place they run before
// they go live, and the internal research process applies the same rules before it drafts
// anything.
//
// The research behind every entry below, with its sources, is kept with the drink-advertising
// rules. Change the two together, and re-check an entry before relying on it past its `checked`
// date: three of these regimes changed in 2024-2026 (Indiana, Alberta, Michigan).
//
// Two severities
// --------------
// "block" stops a deal from going live: the single publish (lifecycle), the draft batch, and a
// restaurant manager's edit to a live deal all refuse it. Only for what is clear from the copy:
// a practice that is banned nearly everywhere (free, unlimited or 2-for-1 drinks, drinking games,
// ladies' nights), a happy hour in a state that bans them, a drink price below the provincial
// minimum, a discount on drinks in Quebec. Each says what to change.
//
// "check" is shown to staff and never stops anything: what depends on facts the copy cannot
// settle, such as whether a price holds for the whole business day, or a happy hour running past a
// state's cutoff (the venue's hours could be misread as easily as broken).
//
// It reads the copy a reader sees, like app/alcohol.ts, because that is what is published.
