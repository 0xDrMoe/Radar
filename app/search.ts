// exceeded their limit on cold isolates, while cheap routes like /sitemap.xml served fine. Reusing
// the formatter instead takes the same 133 deals to 0.83ms.
//
// The map is keyed on timezone because that is the only part that varies: the locale is fixed at
// en-CA (these parts are parsed, never shown), and the options are constant. Unbounded growth is
// not a concern — the key space is the set of IANA zones the catalog actually uses, which is
// around six, and an isolate is recycled long before that could matter.
// Kept here rather than taken from app/formatters.ts, which does the same job for the rest of the
