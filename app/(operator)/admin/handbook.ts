// The staff handbook: how each job here works, and what to do when something refuses.
//
// FILED BY ROLE, NOT BY SCREEN. The sidebar is already organized by area — catalog, moderation,
// money, access — and a second copy of that split would only tell somebody where a button is.
// What a person actually needs is the part written for the work they were hired to do, so the
// sections here are roles: deal editors, moderators, supervisors, marketing, finance, analysts,
// developers, admins and owners. Each article still names the area of the workspace it concerns,
// which is what connects the two.
//
// Three sections carry no role. The first is everybody's, because a workspace with several kinds
// of staff in it needs a shared understanding of what is recorded and what should never be
// improvised. The drink rules are everybody's because the alert that sends people to them sits on
// the overview, which every member of staff opens. The last is everybody's for the opposite
// reason: when something looks broken, the person looking at it is whoever happened to be there.
//
// Content as data rather than as JSX, for three reasons. It can be searched without walking a
// rendered tree; tests/admin-handbook.test.mjs can assert that what it claims still matches the
// code it describes — the conditions for publishing a deal, the refusals the server sends back,
// the rates the affiliate program pays — so an article cannot quietly rot into a lie; and an
// article can be filed against a role and a permission, which is what lets the server decide who
// may read it.
//
// WHO READS WHAT. An article is served only to somebody holding its permission (and, for the few
// that name roles, holding one of those roles); the role-less sections go to everybody who can
// open the workspace. The rule is applied by GET /api/admin/handbook, not by the page: this module
// is imported by that route and by the tests, never by a client component, so the text of an
// article somebody may not read never reaches their browser. Somebody covering another queue asks
// for the permission, and the articles about it arrive with it.
//
// WHAT BELONGS HERE. Things a member of staff cannot work out from the screen in front of them:
// why a control is refusing, what a refusal is protecting, where a number comes from, which of
// two similar-looking actions is the reversible one, and the point where the answer stops being
// "click something" and becomes "ask someone". For anything complicated enough that people get it
// wrong — publishing, verifying more than one address, pausing a market, admitting somebody to
// the mailing list, approving an affiliate, comping a subscription — the steps are written out in
// order, including the parts that are not buttons.
//
// WHAT MUST NOT GO HERE. Anything secret. Restricting an article to a permission narrows who reads
// it; it does not make it a vault, and the role-less sections reach every account that can open
// the workspace, including analyst and any custom role with read_admin. So it holds no keys, no
// tokens, no customer data and no personal email addresses — the protected owner account is
// referred to by role.
//
// Pure, with type-only imports, so the tests can load it on its own and the route can run it
// without anything server-only coming along.
