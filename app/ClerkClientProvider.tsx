 * Mounts Clerk, but only where Clerk is actually needed.
 *
 * Clerk is 8 files and ~240KB compressed — 780KB to parse — and it was loading on every page for
 * every reader, signed in or not. On a deal page arriving from Google that is the largest single
 * thing the browser does, and for a signed-out reader all of it is wasted: the only Clerk component
 * a public page renders is the <UserButton/> in the header, which signed-out readers never see.
 *
 * So it loads for signed-in readers (RootShell passes `active` when the session cookie is present)
 * and on the two pages whose whole job is signing in. Everyone else — every crawler, every visitor
 * from search, every reader browsing deals — gets none of it.
 *
 * Nothing about auth changes: the session cookie is what it always was, the server still verifies
 * it on every request in app/auth.ts, and SiteHeader reads /api/session for its own state rather
 * than asking Clerk. This decides only whether Clerk's client library is downloaded.
