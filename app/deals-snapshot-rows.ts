// A deal of the snapshot as one positional row, and back.
//
// A cold isolate parses the whole snapshot before it can answer anyone, and 44% of what it parsed
// was field names: 76 of them, written out again for every deal - 706 KB of 1.6 MB on 2026-10-03.
// A deal whose fields are exactly ROW_FIELDS, in that order, is sent as an array of its values
// instead, and rebuilt by rowBase.
//
// Rebuilt by an object literal that names every field, and that is the point. Version 4 of the
// snapshot sent rows too, and rebuilt each deal by assigning its fields by computed name
// (`deal[name] = value`): V8 keeps an object built that way in dictionary mode, and copying every
// deal, which each request does, went from under 1 ms to 12.5 ms. A literal builds the same fast
// object JSON.parse does - measured: the copy costs the same 0.07 ms either way, and parsing and
// rebuilding the rows takes 2.3 ms where parsing the objects took 4.1.
//
// The price of a literal is that the list is written down, and a deal's fields are whatever
// `SELECT d.*` returns. So nothing depends on the list being current: baseRow returns null for a
// deal with any other set of fields, in any other order, or holding an undefined, and that deal is
// sent as the object it is, as every deal was before. A column added by a migration makes every
// deal travel that way until it is added here - slower to parse, never wrong - and
// tests/snapshot-rows.test.mjs fails until it is. Nationwide deals carry two more fields
// (footprint_regions, participating_location_count) and always travel as objects; they were 80 of
// 596.
//
// Imports nothing, so the test can load it on its own.
