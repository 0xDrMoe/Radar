// cold one parses the snapshot first. Most requests are not unique - the homepage's first load,
// the nationwide list for a state, a city someone picked - so the first reader in a colo pays and
// the rest are handed the same bytes, without the snapshot being touched at all.
//
// Only for a request nobody is signed in to. A signed-in reader's hidden restaurants shape their
// answer, and getAppUser reads exactly these two places to find one.
//
// Its own module, importing nothing but one function of app/search.ts, because two places ask the
// same question: the route (app/api/deals/route.ts), which writes the shared copy and reads it when
// it is asked directly, and the Worker's entry (worker/index.ts), which reads it ahead of the
// framework, so a shared answer costs a cache lookup and not a trip through the router as well.
// Both must build the same key, so there is one copy of how.
