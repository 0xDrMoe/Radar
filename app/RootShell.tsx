// and `app/(operator)/layout.tsx` are each their own independent root, and this component is
// the one piece of markup/providers they'd otherwise have to duplicate.

  // app/ChromeLink.tsx): plain page loads without the cookie, which the Worker answers from its
  // baked and cached copies, and client-side navigations with it, since the Worker renders every
