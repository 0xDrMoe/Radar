// Why affiliate.radar.cheap is on the list, written here because the test above demands it.
//
// It is the affiliate portal: the same Worker, the same app and the same Clerk instance, served
// under its own name by a rewrite in worker/index.ts. A different hostname is a different origin
// to the browser, so Clerk stamps "https://affiliate.radar.cheap" into `azp` for a token minted
// there, and without this entry every authenticated request from the portal would be refused —
// which reads, to an affiliate, as being signed out on a page that had just shown their name.
//
// It is ours and it stays ours: a subdomain of a domain Radar holds, not a name on a shared host
// that can be claimed by somebody else when it lapses. That is the distinction the pinned list
// exists to enforce, and it is the reason the predecessor project's origin had to come off.

// Localhost is here for development and is not a hole in production: a token minted by a page on
// someone else's machine is still a token Clerk has to have signed for this instance.
//
// `affiliate.localhost` is the same allowance. Every browser resolves *.localhost to the loopback
// address without touching DNS (RFC 6761) and treats it as a secure context, which is what makes
// it usable as a local stand-in for the affiliate subdomain — so it is loopback in every sense
// that matters here, despite not being spelled "localhost".
