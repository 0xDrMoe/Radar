// Bounding the location arrays /api/deals puts on a national chain deal.

// The deal page caps its own list at 250 (see tests/offer-locations-scope.test.mjs). This is the
// same problem one layer out: a deal in the search response carries chain_locations,
// participating_locations and other_brand_locations, three arrays over the same set, and none was
// bounded. It stayed invisible while the biggest chain was a 120-branch Tim Hortons; McDonald's US
// is thousands.
//
// The assertion that matters most is not the cap itself but what the cap does to a count. An array
// that has been trimmed is no longer something to take a length of, and there is a card on the
// homepage whose whole text is that length.
